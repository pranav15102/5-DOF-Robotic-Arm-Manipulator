# 5-DOF-Robotic-Arm-Manipulator
This project involves the design and implementation of a robotic arm manipulator to perform a dispensing task. The manipulator is programmed to collect adhesive strips from a dispenser and apply them to a target object using MATLAB and Simulink. The project includes path planning, collision avoidance, and simulation using inverse kinematics.
# Intrduction
The Robotic Arm Manipulator for Dispensing Task is designed to automate the process of collecting adhesive strips and applying them to target objects. The system is developed using MATLAB and Simulink, leveraging inverse kinematics for accurate and collision-free movements.
# Features
1. Design: A robotic arm capable of precise dispensing tasks.
2. Path Planning: Generation of waypoints for collision-free paths.
3. Simulation: Simulated environment using MATLAB and Simulink to test and validate the robot's tasks.
4. Automation: Automates the task of collecting and applying adhesive strips.
# Setup
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/pranav15102/Robotic-Arm-Dispensing-Task.git
cd Robotic-Arm-Dispensing-Task
